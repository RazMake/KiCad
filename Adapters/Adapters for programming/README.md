This folder contains KiCad projects for PCBs used for connecting various microcontrollers to an Arduino UNO R3 ([~$3](https://www.banggood.com/Geekcreit-UNO-R3-ATmega328P-Development-Board-For-No-Cable-p-964163.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN) 
proto board).  
The Arduino UNO board is then connected to a computer  for [flashing new firmware](https://github.com/RazMake/ArduinoUNOMultiProgrammer/blob/master/README.md) on them.
* **[ESP07](https://github.com/RazMake/KiCad/tree/master/Adapters/Adapters%20for%20programming/Esp07)** - PCB that adapts an ESP07 chip to Arduino UNO R3 headers.  
     *(this also includes the *Gerber* files, for ordering the PCB. Board size: **53** x **48**mm / **2.11** x **1.9** in)*
* **[ATTiny85](https://github.com/RazMake/KiCad/tree/master/Adapters/Adapters%20for%20programming/ATTiny85)** - PCB that adapts an ATTiny85 chip to Arduino UNO R3 headers.  
     *(this also includes the *Gerber* files, for ordering the PCB. Board size: **53** x **49**mm / **2.1** x **1.94** in)*
